## SWOT analysis of leaving us:

In the event that you may not have had sufficient time to contemplate this matter independently, we would like to provide you with some pertinent information:


 |  Strenghts | Weakness  | Opportunities  | Threats  |
|---|---|---|---|
| you are earning more money (we hope)  | well, you probably have more debts as well... good luck!  |  new version of yourself with less bugs, more features, and hopefully, a better coffee machine?! | Maybe the coffe is actually not good (?)      |
| Finally you dont have to fill in CATS anymore!!  | Not Mensa anymore, ALARM!!  | mmmmm there are no more opportunities... sorry!  | You will have to cook or maybe buy food in a more expensive place because there is no Mensa, and then half of your salary will be gone in food which means that probably you should have stayed with us??? think about it!!   |


## Some messages about Timo


> My dearest friend Timo was quite the acquaintance, a humble and diligent fellow, a man of great focus and determination that enriched the lives of the people around him. I send out my deepest gratitude for being fortunate enough to work alongside him and wish him a bright and prosperous future. May the fates align in our favor for a reunion, even if only at the local tavern across the street.

> The individual in question exhibited a consistent inclination towards seeking and inquiring about confectionery, particularly chocolates. His frequent expressions of interest in acquiring such indulgences contribute to an observable pattern of preference for this specific type of treat within the professional environment. I wish for him that he can assure himself an trustable source of such sweets in the future.
